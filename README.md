BasicReservoirSimulator
=======================

This is a basic 2D Reservoir Simulator, developed March 2014 for PTE 508 (project #1). Goal is to eventually account for 3D radial flow in horizontally fractured gas wells, but that's some insane math so starting just with this.

Current assumptions:
-Single phase (black oil assumption)
-2D Flow
-Equally Sized grid blocks
-Equally sized time steps

Contact Tracy for ideas/bugs/code improvements. This is an engineer coding so probably not the most elegant solution :-).
